        <p>I'm a recently graduated developer who likes to make frivolous and sometimes
             meaningful things. I've recently become interested in game development and am thus making my 
             own from scratch. You can follow my progress here or on <a href = "https://github.com/jonathanxue/game-learning-engine" target = _blank>Github</a>.
